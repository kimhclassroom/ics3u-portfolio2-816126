## About me
My name is Unubold Munkhbayar, I was born in Mongolia, and moved here when I was 4. My interests are the outdoors, going fishing, and playing video games with my friends. My goals are to have a basic understanding of coding which can assist me in other STEM courses, and help my work experience.
