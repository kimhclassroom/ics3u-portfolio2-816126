# First Reflection
The Nameplate assignment

- What I struggled with:
- I wanted to make the tail rotor of the helicoptor spin, and eventually I left it static because I couldn't figure out how to use Rotate in a draw, which is how I planned to use it. I would also have to clear the old tailrotor which is out of my expertise. 

- What Iâ€™m proud of:
- Im proud of my car, and my mountain, I used new features like using a circle to round the edges of the hood for the car, and using the triangle command for the first time.

- Next steps:
- Figure out how to make the tail rotor spin, which would also teach me how to animate moving objects, and clear old objects aswell.
