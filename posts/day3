Selection Structure

I added a restart game function, a color selection screen, and worked on room collision. 

Restart game function 

void keyPressed() {
  if (key == 'r' || key == 'R') {
    RestartGame();
    return;
  }

void RestartGame() {
  gameStarted = false;
  colorScreen = false;

  playerX = 100;
  playerY = 500;

  teacherX = 1200;
  teacherY = 500;

  playerColor = color(0, 120, 255);
}

Where I used it and why I did it that way

I used it in keyPressed, where if the player pressed R it would run the function. I did it like this so the player could leave the game and go back to the start screen whenever they wanted. I used if statements to track if the r or capital R key was pressed, if it was it would run the restart function and return to stop the rest of the code from running. 

Challenges I faced and how I solved them
Challenge: Overall it was straightforward, but the first time I tried making this code i didnt use boolean values for the game states, which made it hard to switch between and control which was running.
Fix: I fixed it by using boolean values to run if a certain value is true, or if it was set to true, this lets me easily control the game states, and what's running. 

Color selection screen

if (colorScreen) {
    if (mouseX > backX && mouseX < backX + backW && mouseY > backY && mouseY < backY + backH) {
      colorScreen = false;
      return;
    }
    int radius = 100;
    int gX = width/2 - 250;
    int gY = height/2 + 50;
    if (dist(mouseX, mouseY, gX, gY) < radius) playerColor = color(0, 255, 0);
    int bX = width/2;
    int bY = height/2 + 50;
    if (dist(mouseX, mouseY, bX, bY) < radius) playerColor = color(0, 120, 255);
    int pX = width/2 + 250;
    int pY = height/2 + 50;
    if (dist(mouseX, mouseY, pX, pY) < radius) playerColor = color(255, 105, 180);
Where I used it and why I did it that way

I used it to let the player control the color of the player to their preference. Also it updates what color the player should be to a variable which makes it easy to set multiple things like the preview on the start screen to that color. I used an if statement to track if the mouse is within a certain distance from a color circle, if it was and the mouse was pressed the playerColor value would update. 


Challenges and how I fixed them

Challenge: Getting the x and y values and typing it down was confusing and tedious.
Fix: I made them into variables, and labeled them by color and if it was the x or the y position this made the code easier and simpler to read. 

Room Collision 

I added room collision for the bottom left room to prevent the player from going though the walls

void bottomLeftRoom(){
  if (playerY>600 && playerY<800 && playerX==200){
    if (playerY + 25 < 650 || playerY > 700) {
      playerX= playerX + speed;
    }
  } else if (playerY>600 && playerY<800 && playerX+25==200){
    if (playerY + 25 < 650 || playerY > 700) {
      playerX= playerX - speed;
    }
  }

  if (playerX>=0 && playerX<200 && playerY+25==600){
    playerY= playerY - speed;
  } else if (playerX>=0 && playerX<200 && playerY==600){
    playerY= playerY + speed;
  }
}

Where I used it and why I did it that way

I used it in the drawMap function so it would run if the map was drawn. I used if statements to track the players X and Y, and if it was between certain values and certain locations it would reserve the players speed to prevent them from going though the wall.

Challenges and how I fixed them
Challenges: The player's x and y speed would change at the same time, making the player go up and left, the player could exit from one way, but would stop going the other.
Fix: I made separate if statements for the direction so the proper speed math would be used. I then further separated it so if the player came from any direction it would block it, accordingly.
