Day 4 learning log

  Repetition Structure
I added a timer, and made the teachers follow patrol points repeatedly. 
Teacher movement (repeating patrol)
void teacher() {
  if (millis() >= teacherWaitUntil) {
    if (teacherX < teacherTargetX) teacherX = min(teacherX + teacherSpeed, teacherTargetX);
    else if (teacherX > teacherTargetX) teacherX = max(teacherX - teacherSpeed, teacherTargetX);
    else if (teacherY < teacherTargetY) teacherY = min(teacherY + teacherSpeed, teacherTargetY);
    else if (teacherY > teacherTargetY) teacherY = max(teacherY - teacherSpeed, teacherTargetY);
    if (teacherX == teacherTargetX && teacherY == teacherTargetY) {
      teacherWaitUntil = millis() + 1000;
      if (teacherState == 0) { teacherTargetX = 300; teacherTargetY = 500; teacherState = 1; }
      else if (teacherState == 1) { teacherTargetX = 300; teacherTargetY = 200; teacherState = 2; }
      else if (teacherState == 2) { teacherTargetX = 300; teacherTargetY = 500; teacherState = 3; }
      else if (teacherState == 3) { teacherTargetX = 300; teacherTargetY = 700; teacherState = 4; }
      else if (teacherState == 4) { teacherTargetX = 300; teacherTargetY = 500; teacherState = 5; }
      else { teacherTargetX = 1200; teacherTargetY = 500; teacherState = 0; }

Where I used it and why I did it that way
I used this in runGame(). The repetition is happening because draw() runs over and over, and inside it, runGame() keeps calling the teacher functions. I did it this way so the teacher constantly updates their position a little bit each frame, which makes smooth movement. The teacherState keeps cycling, so the teacher repeats the same patrol pattern instead of stopping after one path. The teacherWaitUntil also makes the teacher pause for a second at each point, but still repeat the whole route. The way it works is that it makes the teacher move in a T shape along points I set. There's 5 states of the teacher and each state represents a point it's moving towards. It also pauses for one second at each point using millis. I did this another time for a teacher that moves only up and down. The code is similar, but it has fewer states since the path is simpler. It moves just in a straight line up and down going from one Y point to the other. 

Challenges I faced and how I solved them
Challenge: At first the teacher wouldn’t repeat the path properly and it would look like it was drifting or teleporting after a restart.
 Fix: I made sure the path always goes back to the exact same checkpoints using the same state order, and I reset all the teacher values in resetTeachers() so every run starts at the same position and state.
