Day 2 Learning Log

Variables

I used variables to add a new color variable to track the color of the player, and a new boolean for the color selection screen.

color playerColor;
boolean colorScreen = false;

Where I used it and why I did it that way
I used playerColor to store the current chosen color so I can use it on the player color, and the preview color. colorScreen tracks if the color selection screen should be displayed. 

Challenges and how I fixed them
Challenge: Right now the playerColor is black, because it hasn’t been initialized. 
Fix: initialize it so that a default color is chosen.

Selection structure

I used an if statement where if the mouse pressed the color screen button it’ll set the boolean colorScreen to true, which will display the color selection screen. 

void draw() {
  if (!gameStarted) {
    drawStartScreen();
  } else {
    runGame();
  }
  if (colorScreen==true){
    drawColorScreen();
  }
}

Where I used it and why I did it this way
This solved the problem of adding a second screen without deleting the start screen. The boolean lets me turn the color screen on when the user clicks the Change Color button.

Challenges and how I fixed them
Challenge:Right now there isn’t a way to set colorScreen back to false, so you can't go back.
Fix: Implement a back button that’ll set the boolean value back to false. 

Custom Functions and Error Checking Restrictions

I added a new custom function for the color selection screen.

void drawColorScreen(){
  background(220);
  drawGridTEMP();
  textAlign(CENTER);
  fill(0);
  textSize(40);
  text("COLOR SELECTED", width/2, 100);
  circle(width/2,height/2+50,200);
  circle(width/2-300,height/2+50,200);
}

Where I used it and why I did it this way

I separated the color screen into its own function so the UI code does not mix with gameplay code. It keeps drawStartScreen and runGame cleaner and makes it easier to expand color options later.

Challenges and how I fixed them
Challenge: I am still filling the player with a fixed color in drawPlayer.
Fix: I will change drawPlayer to fill(playerColor) so the chosen color actually applies to the player, not just the preview circle.
